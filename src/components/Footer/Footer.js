// to build things quickly and have them look great every step of the way.

// Each element is a property of styled, like h3, p, div, etc...

// Components are functions, and they must start with a capital letter
function Footer(props) {
	// {...props} uses the the ES6 spread operator to send any props you may pass
	// along without changing any of the contents. This is basically just creating
	// a copy to pass along
	return <FooterStyle {...props}>{props.children}</FooterStyle>;
}

// This export will be picked up in ./index.js
